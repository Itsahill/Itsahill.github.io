            <li><b>Primary Computer:</b> Dell Inspiron 7620, usually used in my apartment room because it has decided to randomly stop working if I move it around too much. Thanks, Dell!</li>

            <ul>
                <li><b>ITSC 3160-Database Design and Implementation:</b> Required, but I really feel like this will expand on stuff I want to learn for my concentration.</li>
                <li><b>ITIS 3200 - Introduction to Security and Privacy:</b> This is DEFINITELY relevant to my Cybersecurity concentration and I’m really excited for this course.</li>
                <li><b>ITIS 3246 - IT Infrastructure and Security:</b> Also relevant to my concentration, but also would be better for general career help.</li>
