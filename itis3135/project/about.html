        <p>
          My name is Shamil Luqman. I'm a graduate of the University of North
          Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in Advertising and Public
          Relations from the Hussman School of Journalism and Media.

          I originally started as an engineer at North Carolina State
          University, but fell out of working on equations quickly as my
          notebooks got more filled with doodles and stories than numbers.

            and connection; finding ways to make deep connections through design
            and multimedia communication.
