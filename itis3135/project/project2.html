          <b>Role: Art Director, Copywriter, and Strategist</b> <br />
          <b>Insight:</b> Healthcare in America is a complex, expensive system
          with a lot of technical lingo and know-how. The average American still
          reads at an eight-grade reading level.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Solution:</b> A public health education and awareness campaign
          centered on a quick, reliable booklet available for free in health
          centers and a website with carefully integrated AI tools to help
          patients navigate their health journeys.
