          <b>Role: Art Director, Copywriter, and Strategist</b> <br />
          <b>Insight:</b> Healthcare in America is a complex, expensive system
          with a lot of technical lingo and know-how. The average American still
          reads at an eight-grade reading level.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Solution:</b> A public health education and awareness campaign
          centered on a quick, reliable booklet available for free in health
          centers and a website with carefully integrated AI tools to help
          patients navigate their health journeys.

          between stakeholders in US healthcare systems written in plain
          language.

          Searching simple plain language terms like "stomachache" and "head

          The LLM Chatbot summary writer helps you understand the care landscape
          around a condition. When you enter a concern or a diagnosis, it
          cross-references verified clinician-written resources and structured
          codes from the ICD-10-CM to explain what your condition typically
          involves, what questions patients often ask, and what care decisions
          may come next. The result is a clear, plain-language summary you can
          review on your own, or share with your primary care provider to guide
          a more informed conversation.
