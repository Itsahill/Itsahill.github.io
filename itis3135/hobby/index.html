            <h2>What Is Gaming?</h2>
            <p>
                How do you define the activity of playing video games? Simply put, it's using some electronic device to interact with something
                and have fun. But to describe the medium like this is to do it a disservice. Gaming is a complex, multifaceted activity that can be a soft and gentle
                experience or a blood-pumping adrenaline nightmare, and everything in between. They can calm you, confuse you, raise your heart rate, crush you,
                and raise you higher. Games can be a simple pleasure or an art form, and to discount them as simple entertainment would be the same as saying 
                that music just sounds good or movies are nice to look at.

                Okay, enough pretentious pretext; I want to tell you what gaming is like from MY perspective, through MY experiences, and why I do it.
                To me, playing games is something I do to because I enjoy challenge and the feeling of achievement I get when I earn a hard-fought victory(when it's something I want to do, not like work). 
                Challenge is probably a main point of why I enjoy gaming, and though I can complain about some part or other of a difficult game,
                it's (usually) from a place of love.

            <h2>Who Are Games For?</h2>
            <p>
                This question is kind of redundant considering the previous section, but games are for anyone and everyone. Everyone can enjoy games, but not every 
                game is enjoyed by everyone; it depends on what kind of experience you want. Looking to unwind with a relaxing, simple game? Maybe try Animal Crossing or something similar.
                Want a game that's easy to pick up and put down? Tetris is right there? If you're looking for some action, there's a wide array of combat games, from beat-em-ups to fighters
                to shooters. The point is that there's no way someone out there will hate every video game ever. If you can find the right one, they'll fold.

            <p>
                My preferred games are generally something with a lot of action and challenge to them. I regularly play games where I fail often, and get back up to do it again. 
                Some examples of this would be Hyper Light Drifter(pictured here), Dark Souls, and ULTRAKILL. These games require a lot of practice and focus from me, and really 
                get my heart beating in the tense moments. Doing well in these games makes me feel a sense of accomplishment I don't get anywhere else.
