            <h2>What Is Gaming?</h2>
            <p>
                How do you define the activity of playing video games? Simply put, it's using some electronic device to interact with something
                and have fun. But to describe the medium like this is to do it a disservice. Gaming is a complex, multifaceted activity that can be a soft and gentle
                experience or a blood-pumping adrenaline nightmare, and everything in between. They can calm you, confuse you, raise your heart rate, crush you,
                and raise you higher. Games can be a simple pleasure or an art form, and to discount them as simple entertainment would be the same as saying 
                that music just sounds good or movies are nice to look at.

                Okay, enough pretentious pretext; I want to tell you what gaming is like from MY perspective, through MY experiences, and why I do it.
                To me, playing games is something I do to because I enjoy challenge and the feeling of achievement I get when I earn a hard-fought victory(when it's something I want to do, not like work). 
                Challenge is probably a main point of why I enjoy gaming, and though I can complain about some part or other of a difficult game,
                it's (usually) from a place of love.
