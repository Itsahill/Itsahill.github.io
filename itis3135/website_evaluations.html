            <h3>Good Site Design: <a href="https://www.oceanhealthindex.org">Ocean Health Index</a></h3>
            <p>This site is a source to gain knowledge abou the ocean's health and
                how to improve it. It is very well designed and uses CRAP principles well.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C: </b>There is a good sense of contrast in this site, with white text 
                being on dark blue backgrounds, and vice versa in other cases.</li>
                <li><b>R: </b>The website stays consistent with fonts and stye, using slightly 
                rounded boxes for most of its content and maintaining use of blue gradients.</li>
                <li><b>A: </b>The alignment on the header is spaced well, and the main content has 
                great even alignment for its content, separating into halves or thirds depending on 
            what is necessary.</li>
                <li><b>P: </b>Every Element has just enough space so that it does not feel too isolated 
                or too cramped, and the whitespace is used to make the website look cleaner.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bad Site Design: <a href="https://arngren.net">Arngren</a></h3>
            <p>This is a Finnish classifieds site that people use to buy and 
                sell technology and other items. This sit does not use CRAP principles well at all.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C: </b> There is not much contrast used in this site at all, as all of the 
                sections have the same background and border.</li>
                <li><b>R: </b>This website is very inconsistent. Many objects have different border sizes,
                if they have a border at all, and they all have different box sizes.</li>
                <li><b>A: </b> There is no clear sense of alignment on this site. Everything is just put on the page 
                without any rhyme or reason.</li>
                <li><b>P: </b>Everything is WAY too cramped on this website.</li>
